- Add back in more commenting on tests.
- Fix issues in common.rs where functions are claiming that they aren't being used when they clearly are.
- Probably swap creating tags back to a put rather than a post, since it is actually idempotent (sending multiple create requests should *not* update the create time, and hence there theoretically isn't actually anything changing in the system when a duplicate arrives)
- currently the program doesn't initialise the database if there isn't one present when it starts. This, obviously, means it's unusable by anyone who isn't me
- Add an endpoint to manually set next-review date
