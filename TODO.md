- Add back in more commenting on tests.
- Fix issues in common.rs where functions are claiming that they aren't being used when they clearly are.
- Probably swap creating tags back to a put rather than a post, since it is actually idempotent (sending multiple create requests should *not* update the create time, and hence there theoretically isn't actually anything changing in the system when a duplicate arrives)
